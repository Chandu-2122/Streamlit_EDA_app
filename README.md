# Streamlit_EDA_app ðŸ“Š
A one-line Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) experience in a consistent and fast solution using ydata-profiling and Streamlit allowing users to conduct comprehensive EDA effortlessly.

# Working
This app analyzes the uploaded CSV files, providing in-depth insights into the dataset's characteristics through exploratory data analysis techniques.

# Features
**Upload CSV**: Allows users to upload their CSV files for analysis.

**Profiling Report**: Generates an exploratory data analysis report using ydata_profiling.

**Example Dataset**: Offers the option to explore an example dataset in the absence of an uploaded CSV file.

# Usage

**Installation**:

Clone the repository

```git clone```

Install the dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Run the app

```streamlit run main.py```

**Instructions**:

1. Upload your CSV file in the sidebar.
2. View the dataset and explore its characteristics.
3. Analyze the generated profiling report to gain insights.

# Libraries Used

1. **numpy**: used for various numerical operations, especially in generating example datasets or handling numerical data within the analysis.
2. **pandas**: used to read and manipulate CSV files, organize data into DataFrames, and facilitates data exploration and presentation.
3. **streamlit**: used as the primary framework for building the EDA web application, allowing easy integration of data visualizations, user inputs, and data analysis tools.
4. **ydata_profiling**: Used to create comprehensive and interactive exploratory data analysis reports based on the uploaded or example datasets, providing detailed insights into the data's characteristics.
5. **streamlit_pandas_profiling**: Facilitates the direct embedding of Pandas Profiling reports generated by ydata_profiling into the Streamlit app, allowing users to visualize and interact with the analysis within the app interface.

# Usage Notes

Ensure the CSV file adheres to the expected format.

For an initial experience, use the provided example dataset.
